Git commands to create a branch 
-------------------------------------------

git branch "Branch name" 
(to enter the branch directory) 
git checkout "branch name" 
	
	            or 
	git checkout -b "branch name"
{this will create a branch and navigate to that branch }
   
add the changes and push the committed files
 
these will not affect the base(main) branch.

Once the changes are committed to the branch we have an option to create a pull request.  

these changes if accepted will be later merged by the repo admin
