lyrics 

wrong direction -- passenger 

When I was a kid the things I did were hidden under the gird
young and naive I never believed that love could be so well hid
with regret and willing to bet and say the older I get
It gets harder to forgive and harder to forget 
it gets under your shirt like a dagger at work
the first cut is the deepest but the rest still flipping hurt 
you're cynical and sarcastic you made your heart of plastic 
and end up in the corner on your own 


cause I'd love to feel the love but I can't stand the rejection 
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection 
I thought I was close but under further inpsection 
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction no 



so what's the point in getting your hopes up 
when all you're ever getting is choked up 
when you're coked up and can't remember the reason why you broke up 
you call her in the morning when you're coming down and falling 
like an old man on the side of the road 
cause when you're apart you don't want to mingle when you're together you 
wanna be single 
ever the chase to taste the kiss of bliss that made your heart tingle 
oh how much greener the grass is with those rose tainted glasses 
but the butterflies they flutter by and leave us on our asses
