I want to add something to this html document 

Jhon mayer  -- Who says 

Who says I can't get stoned 
turn off the lights and the telephone 
me and my house alone, who says I can't get stoned 

It's been a long night in New York city
It's been a long night in Baten Rouge 
I don't remember you looking any better 
but then again I don't remember you 


who says I can't be free 
from all of the things that I used to be 
rewrite my history 
who says I can't be free

Who says I can't take time 
meet all the girls in the county line 
wait on fate to send a sign 
who says I can't take time 

It's been a long night in New york city
It's been a long time since twenty two 
I don't remember you looking any better 
but then again I don't remember you
